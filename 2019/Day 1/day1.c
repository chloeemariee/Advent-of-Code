// "the fuel required for a module =  its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2"

//Fuel Counter-Upper = how much total fuel needed
//Calculate the fuel for each module (input.txt) and sum them 

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>

//File IO

}

//keep the fuel for each module in an array, you'll need them seperate for part 2
//gotta use tail recursion

//    base case
//    recursive case
